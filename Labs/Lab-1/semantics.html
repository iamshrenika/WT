                 <h2>A message from the principal</h2>
                 <p>Welcome<br>It is a great pleasure that I introduce myself, Birendra Khadka, as the new principal
                   of Gandaki Boarding School popularly known as GBS all across Nepal. Gandaki Boarding School, 
                   is situated at Lamachaur, Pokhara. This school has passed a long way since its establishment back in 1966.
                   GBS, the only regional school in the nation was established By Ministry of Education (MoU), Nepal with the 
                   support and management of United Mission to Nepal (UMN) and local people. It has been functioning as a 
                   not-for-profit educational institution and has been registered under Public Education Trust. GBS is an 
                   autonomous institution. We are delighted that we celebrated the school's golden jubilee year in 2072 BS 
                   with a variety of programmes round the year. We have always been driven by the mission to be an 
                   international centre of academic excellence with the motto - Knowledge, Character and Service. Today 
                   the school has been able to establish itself as one of the finest institutions in the country for the 
                   dynamic and holistic learning opportunities it offers. My passion for education and the success of all
                    students has been shaped over my years serving as a teacher, school principal and Campus Chief.</p>
