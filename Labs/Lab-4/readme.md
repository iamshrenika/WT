## OBJECTIVE : TO LEARN EVENT HANDLING IN JAVASCRIPT  
## THEORY:
### Event handlers:  
These are used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions .  
### Event:  
Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system.For Example :
#### Some Events  
- click
- mouseover  
- keydown  
- load  
- change .....,etc  


#### Some Event Handlers  
- onLoad  
- onMouseOver  
- onSelect  
- onSubmit .....,etc 

The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

#### Syntax:
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);

Here,  The first parameter is the type of the event like "click" or "mousedown"..
The second parameter is the function we want to call when the event occurs.
And ,  
The third parameter is a boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing.
  
## CONCLUSION :
Hence, we learnt Event Handling in JavaScript....
